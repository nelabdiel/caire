# CAIRE (Categorized AI Review Engine)

CAIRE is a web-based application designed to help you organize, cluster, and review AI use cases efficiently. By categorizing AI projects based on their descriptions and titles, CAIRE provides a comprehensive and user-friendly interface to explore and analyze similar projects.

## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Easily upload a CSV file containing your AI project data.
- **Project Categorization**: Automatically categorize projects based on their descriptions and titles using advanced clustering algorithms.
- **Levenshtein Similarity**: Identify and highlight projects with similar titles using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: View projects in a user-friendly interface, with font sizes indicating the size of the project clusters.
- **Detailed Project Insights**: Click on individual projects to see detailed descriptions and find related projects.

Additional Details:
- To test it I used the raw data from the previous AI Inventory Use Case found in: https://github.com/thoppe/Federal-AI-inventory-analysis-2023

Pending:
- Adding environments
- Possibly containarizing it
- Adding other ways to cluster and find similarities
